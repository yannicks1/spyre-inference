"""Native libspyre_comms collective probes.

Each test attempts a *native* base-class collective on a real spyreccl
device_group at TP=2. Probes that are still blocked are marked
xfail(strict=True) so when libspyre_comms gains the native impl and a
comms RPM is rebuilt, the probe flips to passing, the strict-xfail
fails CI, and that's the signal to delete the matching manual fallback
in `spyre_inference.distributed.spyre_communicator`.

These tests are cheap to maintain but each spawns its own pair of
subprocesses, which is slow. They are gated on `>=2` Spyre cards so
they only run on the 2-card pods where the rest of TP=2 testing lives.

The probe bodies live in `tests/probes/tp_probe.py`; the subprocess
plumbing lives in the `run_tp_probe` fixture in `tests/conftest.py`.
