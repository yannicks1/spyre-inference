"""Spyre-specific GeluAndMul implementation (GeGLU).

Gemma models use `gelu_pytorch_tanh` gated MLPs -> vLLM's `GeluAndMul`. The stock
`forward_native` slices the fused `[..., 2*d]` tensor on-device, which corrupts
Spyre memory (same hazard `SpyreSiluAndMul` works around). This mirrors that
override with GELU instead of SiLU.
