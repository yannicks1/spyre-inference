"""DeviceCommunicator override for IBM Spyre devices.

libspyre_comms natively implements: `barrier`, `broadcast`, `send`/`recv`,
list-form `allgather`, `gather`, and `allreduce`. The `_allgather_base`
entry point on the torch-spyre spyreccl backend side is still stubbed,
so `dist.all_gather_into_tensor` does not work.

This class supplies:
  - An `all_gather` that uses native list-form `dist.all_gather` because
    the base class routes through `dist.all_gather_into_tensor` (blocked
    by the `_allgather_base` stub).

Remaining per-op blockers (REPLACE-WITH-NATIVE markers below):
  - all_gather : torch-spyre spyreccl `_allgather_base` (so the base class
                 can use `dist.all_gather_into_tensor` directly).
  - reduce     : libspyre_comms native reduce (not on the TP forward path).

The companion test file `tests/probes/test_spyre_comms_native_probes.py` runs
each native collective on a real spyreccl device_group and is xfail-strict.
When a comms RPM lands an impl, the corresponding probe flips to passing,
the strict-xfail fails CI, and that's the signal to delete the override
here.
