# spyre-inference

## Overview

The `spyre-inference` plugin represents the next iteration of vLLM-Spyre, built on the `torch-spyre` stack. This plugin integrates with `torch-spyre` to leverage the PyTorch Inductor backend for model compilation, providing enhanced performance and optimization capabilities for large language model inference.

## Key Features

- **Torch Inductor Backend**: Utilizes PyTorch's native Inductor compiler for optimized model execution
- **torch-spyre Integration**: Built on the torch-spyre framework for advanced compilation and optimization
- **vLLM Platform Plugin**: Seamlessly integrates with vLLM's plugin architecture via the `vllm.platform_plugins` entry point
- **CPU-Optimized**: Configured for efficient CPU-based inference with vLLM 0.15.1+cpu

## Architecture

The plugin registers itself as a vLLM platform plugin through the entry point:

```python
[project.entry-points."vllm.platform_plugins"]
spyre_next = "spyre_inference:register"
```

This allows vLLM to automatically discover and load the plugin, enabling torch-spyre-based compilation and execution.
