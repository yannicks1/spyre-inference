# Contributing to Spyre Inference

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Spyre plugin for vLLM! There are several ways you can contribute:

- Identify and report any issues or bugs.
- Suggest or implement new features.
- Improve documentation or contribute a how-to guide.

## Developing

Follow the [Installation Guide](../getting_started/installation.md) to get the base package installed, then install the dev dependency group:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

This includes `pytest`, `pyyaml`, and the `spyre-testing-plugin` for running the test suite.

If you already have a local `torch-spyre` checkout installed (e.g. editable, for `torch-spyre` development), a plain `uv sync` will rebuild and reinstall the pinned git rev from `pyproject.toml`, discarding it. To keep your local install instead:

```bash
uv sync --group dev --no-install-package torch-spyre --inexact
```

`--no-install-package torch-spyre` skips resolving and rebuilding the pinned rev; `--inexact` stops uv from uninstalling the now-unreferenced local package. Note this only affects `uv sync` itself — any subsequent plain `uv run` will still re-sync and revert it, so use `uv run --no-sync …` for those (see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Iterating on a Local `torch-spyre` Checkout" section).

### One venv for both repos

To work on a `torch-spyre` bug and validate against both test suites, build on this repo's venv — it already carries the pinned `torch` and `vllm` — then add your `torch-spyre` checkout and its dev dependencies:

```bash
cd spyre-inference
uv sync --group dev --no-install-package torch-spyre --inexact
uv pip install -e ~/torch-spyre
uv pip install --group ~/torch-spyre/pyproject.toml:dev
```

`spyre-testing-plugin` is scoped to this repo — it is activated by an `addopts` entry in our `pyproject.toml` rather than a global `pytest11` entry point — so `pytest` inside `torch-spyre` behaves exactly as it does without spyre-inference installed. Run each suite from its own checkout.

### Linting

When submitting a PR, please make sure your code passes all linting checks. We use prek with a .pre-commit-config.yaml file to run checks on every commit.

The `format.sh` script will run prek from an isolated virtual environment using [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/). The only requirement is that you have `uv` installed.

```sh
bash format.sh
```

Alternatively, you can [install prek](https://github.com/j178/prek?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and set up a git hook to run it on every commit with:

```sh
prek install
```

### Testing

The project includes both local tests (located in `tests/`) for spyre-inference specific functionality, and upstream vLLM tests automatically cloned from the vLLM repository at the commit specified in `pyproject.toml`, for compatibility verification.

#### Test Markers

The test suite uses pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
--8<-- "pyproject.toml:test-markers-definition"
```

Upstream vLLM tests are opt-in: they are cloned and collected only when the `-m` expression names the `upstream` marker, or `--upstream` is passed. A negative mention doesn't count, so `-m "not upstream"` and `-m "attention and not upstream"` skip the clone entirely.

```bash
# Run only local tests (no vLLM clone)
pytest

# Run all upstream tests
pytest -m upstream

# Run upstream attention tests only (see tests/plugin/spyre_testing_plugin/upstream_tests.yaml for markers on upstream tests)
pytest -m "attention and upstream"

# Run local AND upstream attention tests: --upstream adds them to a marker
# expression that doesn't name `upstream` itself
pytest --upstream -m "attention"
```

#### Upstream Test Integration

Upstream tests are cloned from the vLLM repository at the commit pinned in `pyproject.toml`, fetching only the `tests/` directory. The clone happens on demand, the first time a run asks for upstream tests (see the marker gate above). Cloned tests are cached in `~/.cache/vllm-upstream-tests` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/vllm-upstream-tests`) with separate worktrees per commit, allowing multiple vLLM versions to be tested simultaneously. All upstream tests run with `VLLM_PLUGINS=spyre_inference,spyre_inference_ops` set automatically. Pointing the plugin at a vLLM checkout instead of the cache is the one case that still needs the flag by hand: `pytest -p spyre_testing_plugin.pytest_plugin -m upstream` from the checkout root. See `tests/plugin/spyre_testing_plugin/pytest_plugin.py` for implementation details.

!!! tip
    To force a re-clone, remove `~/.cache/vllm-upstream-tests`.

    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.cache/vllm-upstream-tests
    ```

#### Configuration

**--upstream**: Collect upstream tests even when the `-m` expression doesn't name the `upstream` marker.

**SKIP_UPSTREAM_TESTS**: Skip upstream tests entirely, overriding both the `-m` expression and `--upstream`. Accepts `1`, `true`, or `yes`.

**VLLM_COMMIT**: Override the vLLM commit SHA from `pyproject.toml`.

**VLLM_REPO_URL**: Override the vLLM repository URL. Defaults to `https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm`.

**UPSTREAM_TESTS_PATHS**: Not currently consumed by the plugin — the set of upstream test paths is auto-derived from the `rel_path` entries in `tests/plugin/spyre_testing_plugin/upstream_tests.yaml`.

!!! tip
    Environment variables can be passed directly to the `pytest` command, e.g. `VLLM_COMMIT=abc123def456 pytest -m upstream`.

### Docs

Install MkDocs along with the [plugins](https://github.com/torch-spyre/spyre-inference/blob/main/mkdocs.yaml) used in the Spyre Inference documentation.

```bash
uv pip install -r docs/requirements-docs.txt
```

!!! note
    Ensure that your Python version is compatible with the plugins (e.g., `mkdocs-awesome-nav` requires Python 3.10+)

MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the `mkdocs.yaml` configuration file and run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser to see a live preview. For additional features and advanced configurations, refer to the official [MkDocs Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
